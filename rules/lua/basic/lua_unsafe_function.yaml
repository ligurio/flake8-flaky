      description: Unsafe function.
    message: |
      Detected the use of loadstring(). loadstring() can be
      dangerous if used to evaluate dynamic content. If this
      content can be input from outside the program, this may be
      a code injection vulnerability. Ensure evaluated content is
      not definable by external sources.
      Lua 5.2 does not have bytecode verification anymore. So,
      all functions that load code (`load` and `loadfile`) are
      potentially insecure when loading untrusted binary data.
      (Actually, those functions were already insecure because of
      flaws in the verification algorithm.) When in doubt, use
      the mode argument of those functions to restrict them to
      loading textual chunks.
